Too many people and the court limits the fun during a great badminton session..?? we've all been there..!! Instead of arguing, seamlessly enjoy your badminton session with friends – all fair and square, so you don’t ever have to worry about the game's fairness.

Badminton Manager was built for exactly that moment: when you have 5, 7, 10, or even 15 friends, one court, and the eternal chaos of “Who plays next?”, “Why are they teaming again?”, and “Bro, you played 4 times already!”.

This app replaces all that noise with an elegant, data-driven matchmaking engine that keeps the game fair, fun, and drama-free. Acess here: https://fairminton.netlify.app/

🎯 What This App Does

Badminton Manager automatically:

Generates fair singles or doubles matchups

Ensures equal playtime for everyone

Avoids repeat partners and repeat opponents

Prevents strong players from dominating

Allows winners to stay for max 2 consecutive matches (customisable fair-play rule)

Tracks player stats, wins, partner history, opponent history

Creates real tournament brackets

Lets you tune the matchmaking algorithm using sliders

Provides heatmaps for partnerships and rivalries

In short: You show up, you enter names, you click start — the rest just works.

⚙️ Core Features

Fair Play Engine (Queue Mode)
This mode is for casual badminton sessions.

It uses:

A priority queue

Match-history–based diversity

A dynamic scoring system

A partner/opponent penalty model

Skill balancing

Consecutive-win rules

…to create the fairest match possible each round.

No fixed teams. No repeated duos. No one hogs the court.

Tournament Mode (Bracket Mode)
Creates a full knockout bracket:

Auto-seeded

Power-of-2 padded

BYE handling

Match progression

Champion detection

Perfect for events or semi-competitive sessions.

🧠 How the Fairness Algorithm Works

The pairing engine evaluates every possible doubles split using three independent factors:

Partner Repetition (exponential penalty)

Playing with the same partner again gets punished heavily.

Opponent Repetition (linear penalty)

Facing the same team repeatedly is discouraged.

Skill Balance (linear penalty)

Attempts to avoid lopsided “3-star + 3-star vs 1-star + 1-star” matches.

Custom Slider Weights

You can tune:

Partner diversity weight

Opponent diversity weight

Skill balance weight

This gives you control depending on how serious or chill your group is.

📊 Heatmaps & Stats

The app records all:

Partnerships formed

Opponent matchups

Wins

Total matches played

You can see:

Partner matrix (how many times each pair has teamed)

Opponent matrix

Match variance

Average matches

This adds transparency and trust — no more “You’re making this up” arguments.

🏸 Why This Exists

Because badminton is supposed to be fun. Because nobody wants to be the “matchmaking admin” every time. Because your friends will fight over anything if you give them a chance.

This app solves all of that with:

Logic

Math

Match-history memory

A bit of randomness

And a fairness engine that never gets tired

Badminton becomes fun again — for everyone.
